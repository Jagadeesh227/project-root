This is a simple web page that shows a list of names and a button. When you click the button, the list gets sorted alphabetically.
There are external CSS and JS files:
assets/css/styles.css → for styling
assets/js/sort.js → for the sorting logic in JavaScript
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Allows the page to handle all kinds of characters (including symbols, foreign languages).
<meta name="viewport">: Makes the page responsive on mobile devices.
<title>: Sets the name you see in the browser tab.
<link rel="stylesheet">: Connects the external CSS file for styling.
  
FOR SORTING:
  
When we click “Sort Alphabetically.”
The sortList() function runs (from sort.js).
It takes the list of names and sorts them from A to Z.
The page updates to show the names in order.

FOR FAQ:

When we click on a question (the <summary>), it expands and shows the answer.
Click again, and it hides.

FOR INDEX:

You fill in your name, email, and message.
Click Submit.
JavaScript in form.js will shown an alert message form submitted sucessfully with time taken to submit.
